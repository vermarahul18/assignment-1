          defeat to South Korea. The shock result sees them eliminated in the first round of the tournament for the first
          time in 80 years. Germany would have progressed with a win at the Kazan Arena but barely looked capable of scoring
          against the Koreans, let alone going on to successfully defend the title they won in Brazil four years ago

        <p class="three_img">The World Cup could not be left without Messi, and it isn’t. Not yet, anyway. Argentina advanced to the Round of
          16 Tuesday in dramatic fashion, with a 2-1 victory over Nigeria, and thanks in part to Croatia’s 2-1 win over Iceland.
          But whereas Messi qualified for Russia despite his teammates, this time he needed a little bit of help. And he
          got it turning home from 10 yards at a slight angle after Ever Banega superbly found him from deep. His finish
          was out of the keepers reach.</p>

        <p class="three_img">They did so with the sort of occasionally dazzling performance that suggests they are growing into a tournament that
          they are one of the favourites to win, as they put behind them their slow start in Russia. Paulinho had deservedly
          put Brazil in front with a deft finish after a brilliant run from deep saw him convert Coutinho's through ball.
          Tite's team had to protect a lead for a 15-minute period at the start of the second half as Serbia went for the
          win.</p>

        <p class="three_img">Luis Suarez brought the host nation back down to earth with a bump in the city upon which the Russian space programme
          was forged. Conjuring images of the James Bond villain Jaws eating through cosmic cables in Moonraker, his curling
          free-kick launched Uruguay launched into the last-16 as Group A winners. Suarez ended both of his last two World
          Cup appearances in disgrace with a deliberate handball in South Africa and sinking his teeth into Giorgio Chiellini
          in Brazil</p>

        <h4 class="stories_heading">The Infamous Goal</h4>
        <img src="img/maradona.jpg" alt="maradona image" class="maradona_img" align="right">
        <p class="stories_para">
          <span class="oneword">T</span>he Hand of God started with a bit of Maradona brilliance. The No.10 skipped past Glenn Hoddle and then
          squeezed in between two more England players before sliding a pass out to Valdano and making his way into the box.
          The ball skipped up on Valdano's foot and Hodge wildly hooked it into his own penalty area, where Maradona rose
          and punched the ball past the onrushing Shilton. None of the officials spotted it - and so did no one else, for
          a while, except the England players in the vicinity who began their desperate appeals to referee Ali Bin Nasser.
          The English commentator, Barry Davies, wondered why they were claiming an offside when the ball had clearly been
          played by Hodge, not an Argentina player. Davies spotted that Maradona's arm was raised on a replay, but there
          was still some doubt at that point as to what had actually happened. Maradona did a good job of selling it by wheeling
          away in celebration, though his quick glances at the officials were telling. Bin Nasser, standing outside the box
          closer to England's left touchline, probably had his sightline partially blocked by Shilton and the crowd of bodies
          but the linesman on the opposite side, Bogdan Dotchev, should have had an unobstructed view.

        <p class="footer_para">
          <span class="oneword">O</span>n 16 July 1950, the Uruguayan winger, Alcides Ghiggia, walked out in front of about 200,000 Brazilian fans
          at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro.It was a fantastic atmosphere. Their supporters were jumping with joy
          as if they'd already won the World Cup," he says. Brazil was so confident of winning the tournament that a samba
          band stood on the sidelines e pitch, ready to play a new song called Brazil the Winners. Local newspapers had already
          printed special editions proclaiming the hosts "Champions of the World". "Everyone was saying they'd thrash us
          three or four nil. I tried not to look at the crowd and just to get on with the match," Ghiggia recalls.Gradually,
          Ghiggia got the better of his Brazilian marker and, on 66 minutes, he put in the cross which led to Juan Alberto
          Schiaffino scoring the equaliser for Uruguay.
